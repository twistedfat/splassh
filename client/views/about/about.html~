<P class="p0 ft2"><SPAN class="ft0"><strong><u>What is SPLASSH? </u></strong></SPAN>SPLASSH (<SPAN class="ft1">http://splassh.org</SPAN>) is a socially driven network that crowdsources the condition of our waterways. The mission of SPLASSH is to inspire water conservation through awareness by engaging students, citizen scientists, and professionals to share, discuss, connect, and visually consume information about water.</P>
<P class="p1 ft5"><SPAN class="ft3"><strong><u>How does SPLASSH inspire water conservation?</u></strong> </SPAN>Currently a vast amount of information collected by students, citizen scientists, and professionals about their watershed is not shared with the water community. SPLASSH’s goal is to serve as a platform where students, citizen scientists, and professionals can post their water projects, gain recognition for their contributions, and connect with other water investigators. The SPLASSH site is designed specifically with this goal in mind and can be used to capture valuable aquatic information, facilitate dialogue about water, and help us to better understand the state of our local, national, and even international waterways. After all, we are all connected to water<SPAN class="ft4">, </SPAN>and all bodies of water are connected.</P>
<P class="p2 ft7"><SPAN class="ft6"><strong><u>How is SPLASSH different than other sites?</u> </strong></SPAN>SPLASSH is a framework that collects information about water in <NOBR>real-time,</NOBR> encourages dialogue between interested parties, and most importantly, it fosters the building of communities based upon an interest in water. SPLASSH doesn’t require any training or commitment and accepts all posts about water from anyone who has an interest in, observation of, or concern about water. For more information, please see the SPLASSH paper (Adams et al., 2013) in: Oceans 2013, MTS/IEEE San Diego – An Ocean in Common. Marine Technology Society/IEEE, pages <NOBR>1-9.</NOBR></P>
<P class="p3 ft7"><SPAN class="ft6"><strong><u>How do you access SPLASSH?</u></strong> </SPAN>It’s simple! Log onto <SPAN class="ft8">http://splassh.org</SPAN>. Our home page is where the dialogue about water begins. In the SPLASSH text box, enter your water project and choose from one of the categories we provide to help you appropriately tag your comment. Hit submit and see your post appear on the map. Just comment, tag, and submit, and you’ll be a part of the SPLASSH community! In essence, SPLASSH’s first phase is an education and outreach tool about water for anyone that wants to share water projects or learn more about the most important resource we have: water.</P>
<P class="p4 ft7">There are many exciting things on the horizon for SPLASSH, and we welcome users to pilot these new additions. We have partnered with Georgia Tech’s Computing for Good Computer Science Team (class of 2014 & 2015) and will soon be releasing a <SPAN class="ft8">biological, chemical, and physical data upload feature </SPAN>that will also collect information about the contributor and data collection technique. Metadata will be archived that will allow interested parties to search and filter data. In addition to the data tool, SPLASSH plans to release new <SPAN class="ft8">media </SPAN>and <SPAN class="ft8">notification </SPAN>tools in January 2016. Stay tuned, because SPLASSH may just change the way we think, talk, and learn about water.</P>
